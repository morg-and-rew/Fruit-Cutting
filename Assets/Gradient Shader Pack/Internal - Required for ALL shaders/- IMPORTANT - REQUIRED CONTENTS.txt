The contents of this folder MUST be included in your project!


Gradient Shader Pack's shaders are built using Unity's Shader Graph. The shaders use one or more shader "sub graphs", which are stored as separate asset files in this folder. These act like subroutines or functions, providing shared functionality across shaders.

In order for Unity to be able to build the shaders and use them in your project, the sub-graphs used by the main shaders must be present in your project, as well as the main shader file for your material.

For example the "Vertical Unlit Solid" shader uses:
- BasicGradientParametersUV0
- GradientVertical
sub-graphs, so requires those two files to be present as well. It does not matter where they are located so long as Unity sees them.

You can be selective in narrowing down which sub graphs you include in the project (so save size etc), based on which shader(s) you're using. You can look inside the shader graphs to see which ones are referenced.

But the simplest way is to make sure this folder is included in your project regardless of which shader(s) you are using. Otherwise the shaders will not work.
